# Generative AI with Diffusion Models

## Overview
This repository contains my work and notebooks related to NVIDIA's *Generative AI with Diffusion Models* course. It includes implementations of diffusion models, training pipelines, and assessments using the MNIST dataset.

## Assessment Completion
I successfully completed the final assessment with **96% accuracy**, surpassing the required 95% benchmark for certification.

## Contents
- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks covering key concepts and experiments from the course.
- **DDPM Implementation**: Training and testing diffusion models for image generation.
- **MNIST Data Processing**: Preprocessing and loading the MNIST dataset for training.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Scripts to measure the quality of generated images.

## Dependencies
To run the notebooks, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to **NVIDIA** for providing the course and resources that helped refine my understanding of diffusion models and generative AI.
